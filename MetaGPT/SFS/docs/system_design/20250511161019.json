{"Implementation approach":"We will utilize a JavaScript framework such as React or Angular to create an interactive and engaging web application for the Space Fractions system. The application will be designed to provide a user-friendly interface for administrators to update questions and content, as well as an adaptive and dynamic gameplay experience for sixth-grade students.","File list":["index.html","main.js","game.js","admin.js","questions.js","fractions.js"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class SpaceFractions {\n        -Game game\n        -Admin admin\n        -Questions questions\n        +init() str\n    }\n    class Game {\n        -FractionOperations fraction_operations\n        -Feedback feedback\n        +play() str\n    }\n    class Admin {\n        -QuestionManager question_manager\n        +updateQuestions() str\n    }\n    class Questions {\n        -Question question\n        +getQuestions() list\n    }\n    class FractionOperations {\n        +addFractions(fractions: list) str\n        +subtractFractions(fractions: list) str\n        +multiplyFractions(fractions: list) str\n        +divideFractions(fractions: list) str\n    }\n    class Feedback {\n        +provideFeedback(score: int) str\n    }\n    class QuestionManager {\n        +updateQuestion(question: str) str\n        +deleteQuestion(question: str) str\n    }\n    class Question {\n        -text: str\n        -answer: str\n        +getText() str\n        +getAnswer() str\n    }\n    SpaceFractions --> Game\n    SpaceFractions --> Admin\n    SpaceFractions --> Questions\n    Game --> FractionOperations\n    Game --> Feedback\n    Admin --> QuestionManager\n    Questions --> Question\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant SF as SpaceFractions\n    participant G as Game\n    participant A as Admin\n    participant Q as Questions\n    participant FO as FractionOperations\n    participant F as Feedback\n    participant QM as QuestionManager\n    SF->>G: play()\n    G->>FO: addFractions(fractions)\n    FO-->>G: return result\n    G->>F: provideFeedback(score)\n    F-->>G: return feedback\n    SF->>A: updateQuestions()\n    A->>QM: updateQuestion(question)\n    QM-->>A: return result\n    A->>Q: getQuestions()\n    Q-->>A: return questions\n    SF->>Q: getQuestions()\n    Q-->>SF: return questions\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification is needed on the specific technical requirements for the system, such as the type of web browser and Flash movie capabilities.
