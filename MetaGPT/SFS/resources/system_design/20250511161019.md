## Implementation approach

We will utilize a JavaScript framework such as React or Angular to create an interactive and engaging web application for the Space Fractions system. The application will be designed to provide a user-friendly interface for administrators to update questions and content, as well as an adaptive and dynamic gameplay experience for sixth-grade students.

## File list

- index.html
- main.js
- game.js
- admin.js
- questions.js
- fractions.js

## Data structures and interfaces

    class Questions {
        -Question question
        +getQuestions() list

    class FractionOperations {
        +addFractions(fractions: list) str
        +subtractFractions(fractions: list) str
        +multiplyFractions(fractions: list) str
        +divideFractions(fractions: list) str

    class Feedback {
        +provideFeedback(score: int) str
    }
    class QuestionManager {
        +updateQuestion(question: str) str
        +deleteQuestion(question: str) str
    }
    class Question {
        -text: str
        -answer: str
        +getText() str
        +getAnswer() str
    }
    SpaceFractions --> Game
    SpaceFractions --> Admin
    SpaceFractions --> Questions
    Game --> FractionOperations
    Game --> Feedback
    Admin --> QuestionManager
    Questions --> Question

    A->>Q: getQuestions()
    Q-->>A: return questions
    SF->>Q: getQuestions()
    Q-->>SF: return questions


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification is needed on the specific technical requirements for the system, such as the type of web browser and Flash movie capabilities. Additionally, further clarification is required on the design of the user-friendly interface for administrators to update questions and content.
