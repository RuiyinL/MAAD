## Original Requirements

This is the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Space Fractions system.

## Project Name

space_fractions

## Product Goals

- Create an engaging and interactive learning experience for sixth-grade students
- Improve fraction-solving skills through adaptive and dynamic gameplay
- Provide a user-friendly interface for administrators to update questions and content

## User Stories

- As a sixth-grade student, I want to learn fraction-solving skills through an interactive and engaging game
- As a teacher, I want to be able to update questions and content to keep the game relevant and challenging for my students
- As a student, I want to receive feedback on my performance and be able to track my progress
- As a student, I want to be able to play the game at my own pace and have the option to try again
- As a teacher, I want to be able to access additional educational resources and tools to support my teaching

## Competitive Analysis

- Math Games A: Simple and interactive, but limited content and no administrative features
- Fraction Workshop: Comprehensive and interactive, but complex interface and limited accessibility
- Math Playground: Engaging and interactive, but limited focus on fractions and no administrative features
- Khan Academy: Comprehensive and interactive, but limited focus on fractions and no administrative features
- Coolmath Games: Simple and interactive, but limited content and no administrative features

## Requirement Analysis

The Space Fractions system requires a web browser capable of running Flash movies and a user-friendly interface for administrators to update questions and content. The system should provide an engaging and interactive learning experience for sixth-grade students, with adaptive and dynamic gameplay, feedback on performance, and the option to try again.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'The system shall provide an introductory movie to set up the storyline and provide background information']
- ['P0', 'The system shall have a main menu with a brief help section and links to the game and external educational resources']
- ['P0', "The system shall have a series of fraction questions that test the user's knowledge of basic fraction operations"]
- ['P1', "The system shall provide feedback on the user's performance and allow them to track their progress"]
- ['P1', 'The system shall allow administrators to update questions and content through a user-friendly interface']

## UI Design draft

The UI shall be simple, intuitive, and engaging, with a focus on interactive gameplay and feedback. The system shall have a main menu with clear instructions and links to the game and external educational resources.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific technical requirements for the system, such as the type of web browser and Flash movie capabilities, are unclear and require further clarification.
