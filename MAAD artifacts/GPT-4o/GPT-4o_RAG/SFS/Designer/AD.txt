# Space Fractions System Architecture Document

## 1. Goals

The primary objectives of the Space Fractions system architecture are:

- **Compatibility and Usability**: Ensure the system is compatible with web browsers that support Flash, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Modularity and Independence**: Design the system as a standalone application, ensuring all functionalities are self-contained.
- **Usability and User Experience**: Support real-time score calculation and ranking, enhancing user engagement.
- **Flexibility and Maintainability**: Allow administrators to customize fraction questions without affecting core functionality.
- **Portability and Accessibility**: Ensure cross-platform compatibility, allowing access from any Internet-accessible computer.
- **Adaptability and User Experience**: Provide dynamic and adaptive storylines based on user progress.
- **Availability and Accessibility**: Ensure high availability and accessibility via the S2S website.
- **Reliability and Quality Assurance**: Implement comprehensive testing frameworks to ensure system reliability.

## 2. Detailed Architecture Design

### System Components and Modules

- **User Interface (UI)**
  - **Main Menu**: Displays options to start the game, access resources, or view help.
  - **Introductory Movie**: Sets up the storyline, with an option to skip.
  - **Help Section**: Provides basic instructions on system play.
  - **Game Interface**: Facilitates user interaction during gameplay.

- **Core System**
  - **Scoring Engine**: Calculates and displays user scores.
  - **Storyline Engine**: Generates and adapts storylines based on user performance.
  - **Question Management System**: Manages and updates fraction questions.

- **Web Browser Interface**
  - **Flash Support**: Ensures compatibility with Flash-enabled browsers.
  - **Browser Compatibility**: Adapts to various browser configurations.

- **Administrative Interface**
  - **Question Editor**: Allows administrators to update and edit questions.
  - **Real-time Updates**: Ensures content updates without system interruptions.

- **Network Infrastructure**
  - **Web Server**: Hosts the Space Fractions system.
  - **Network Configuration**: Ensures reliable connectivity and performance.

- **Testing Framework**
  - **Quality Assurance Tools**: Supports extensive testing for reliability.

## 3. Component & Connector Specifications

### Communication Protocols

- **REST API Contracts**: Used for interactions between the UI and Core System, ensuring stateless communication and scalability.
- **Event-Driven Messaging**: Utilized for real-time updates and dynamic content generation, supporting asynchronous communication.

### Error-Handling Mechanisms

- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensures the system continues to function with reduced capabilities in case of component failures.
- **Retry Logic**: Implements automatic retries for transient errors in network communication.

### Performance Thresholds

- **Response Time**: UI interactions should have a response time of less than 200ms.
- **Throughput**: The system should handle up to 100 concurrent users without performance degradation.

## 4. Key Technologies

### Infrastructure Configuration

- **Web Server**: Apache or Nginx, configured for high availability and load balancing.
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL, optimized for read-heavy operations.

### Scalability and Fault-Tolerance Trade-offs

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers to handle increased load, ensuring scalability.
- **Redundancy**: Implement redundant components to enhance fault tolerance.

## 5. Design Decisions

### Chosen Design Patterns

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
- **Observer Pattern**: Supports dynamic content updates and real-time feedback.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of the Scoring Engine for consistent score calculations.

### Technology Selections

- **Flash**: Chosen for its rich multimedia capabilities, despite its deprecation.
- **HTML5**: Considered for future-proofing and broader compatibility.

## 6. Design Decision Rationale

### Justification of Technology Choices

- **Flash**: Selected due to existing content and interactive multimedia requirements, despite its limitations.
- **REST API**: Chosen for its simplicity, scalability, and statelessness, aligning with web-based architecture.

### Pattern Adoption Explanation

- **MVC**: Adopted to separate user interface, business logic, and data management, facilitating easier updates and maintenance.
- **Observer Pattern**: Enables real-time updates and dynamic content adaptation, enhancing user engagement.
