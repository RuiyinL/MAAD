### Mismatch Analysis Report

#### [Mismatch 1: Flash Dependency]
- **Description**: The system requirements specify that the Space Fractions system requires a web browser capable of running Flash movies. However, Flash has been deprecated and is no longer supported by most modern web browsers.
- **Impact**: This dependency on Flash significantly limits the system's accessibility and usability, as users with modern browsers will be unable to access the system. It also poses security risks and reduces the system's future-proofing.
- **Recommendation**: Transition the multimedia content from Flash to HTML5 or another modern web technology that is widely supported and secure. This will enhance compatibility and ensure the system remains accessible to all users.

#### [Mismatch 2: Real-Time Score Calculation]
- **Description**: The requirements emphasize real-time score calculation and feedback, but the architectural design does not explicitly detail the mechanisms for achieving this, particularly in terms of data processing and storage.
- **Impact**: Without a clear implementation strategy, there may be delays or inaccuracies in score calculation, affecting user experience and engagement.
- **Recommendation**: Define and implement a robust data processing pipeline that ensures efficient real-time score calculation. Consider using in-memory data stores or caching mechanisms to enhance performance.

#### [Mismatch 3: Dynamic Storyline Adaptation]
- **Description**: The requirements specify a dynamic and adaptive storyline based on user progress, but the architectural design lacks detailed mechanisms for implementing this feature.
- **Impact**: The absence of a clear strategy for dynamic content generation could lead to a static user experience, reducing engagement and educational effectiveness.
- **Recommendation**: Develop a detailed plan for implementing dynamic storylines, possibly using a rule-based system or AI-driven content adaptation to tailor the experience based on user interactions and performance.

#### [Mismatch 4: Cross-Platform Compatibility]
- **Description**: The system is intended to be cross-platform, but the reliance on Flash contradicts this goal, as Flash is not supported on many platforms.
- **Impact**: This inconsistency limits the system's reach and usability across different devices and operating systems.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure all system components are developed using cross-platform technologies, such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, to maximize compatibility and accessibility.

#### [Mismatch 5: Administrative Interface for Question Updates]
- **Description**: The requirements highlight the need for a flexible question management system, but the architectural design does not provide sufficient detail on the administrative interface's capabilities and user experience.
- **Impact**: A lack of clarity in the administrative interface could lead to difficulties in updating and managing educational content, affecting the system's adaptability and relevance.
- **Recommendation**: Expand the architectural design to include detailed specifications for the administrative interface, ensuring it is user-friendly and supports efficient content management.

#### [Mismatch 6: Security and Reliability]
- **Description**: The requirements mention security and reliability, but the architectural documentation does not thoroughly address these aspects, particularly in terms of data protection and system resilience.
- **Impact**: Insufficient focus on security and reliability could lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, undermining user trust and system integrity.
- **Recommendation**: Incorporate comprehensive security measures, such as encryption and secure authentication, and design for high availability and fault tolerance to enhance system reliability.

By addressing these mismatches, the Space Fractions system can better align with its requirements, ensuring a more robust, accessible, and engaging educational platform.
