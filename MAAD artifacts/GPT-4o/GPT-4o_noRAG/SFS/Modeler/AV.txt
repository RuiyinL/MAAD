These diagrams provide a logical view of the Space Fractions system, illustrating the key components, their interactions, and the lifecycle of the system.To create the "Logic View" using PlantUML syntax, we will generate both a Package Diagram and a Component Diagram based on the provided requirements. These diagrams will help visualize the modular structure and high-level components of the Space Fractions system.

### Development View:

#### 1. Package Diagram
The Package Diagram will represent the modular structure of the system, showing the organization of code into packages, their dependencies, and hierarchical relationships.

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Space Fractions System" {
    package "User Interface" {
        [Main Menu]
        [Introductory Movie]
        [Help Section]
    }
    
    package "Gameplay" {
        [Question Engine]

These diagrams provide a clear and informative representation of the Space Fractions system's architecture, highlighting the modular structure and component interactions.To generate the "Logic View" using PlantUML syntax, I'll create the requested diagrams based on the provided requirements. Let's start with the Process View:

### Process View:

#### 1. Activity Diagram
This diagram will represent a dynamic workflow for user interaction and navigation within the Space Fractions system.

```plantuml
@startuml
start
:Display Introductory Movie;
if (User skips movie?) then (yes)
  :Display Main Menu;
else (no)
  :Play Introductory Movie;
  :Display Main Menu;
endif

repeat
  :User selects option;
  if (Option is "Start Game") then (yes)
    :Present Fraction Questions;
    repeat
      :User answers question;
      if (Answer is correct?) then (yes)
        :Provide positive feedback;
      else (no)
        :Provide corrective feedback;
      endif
    repeat while (More questions?)
    :Display Concluding Scene;
  else (no)
    if (Option is "Access Resources") then (yes)
      :Open Math Umbrella;
    else (no)
      if (Option is "Help") then (yes)
        :Display Help Section;
      endif
    endif
  endif
repeat while (User navigates)
stop
@enduml
```

#### 2. Sequence Diagram
This diagram will depict the interaction between system components during a gameplay session.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web Browser" as wb
participant "Space Fractions System" as sfs
participant "Question Engine" as qe
participant "Storyline Manager" as sm
participant "Feedback Module" as fm

User -> wb: Open Space Fractions
wb -> sfs: Load Introductory Movie
sfs -> User: Display Introductory Movie
User -> sfs: Skip or Watch Movie
sfs -> wb: Display Main Menu

These diagrams provide a clear and informative representation of the Space Fractions system's logic view, illustrating the dynamic workflow, interactions, and structural organization of the system components.To create the Logic View using PlantUML syntax, we will generate two diagrams: a Deployment Diagram and a Container Diagram. These diagrams will illustrate the physical deployment of system components and the high-level software architecture, respectively.

### Process View:

#### 1. Deployment Diagram
The Deployment Diagram models the physical deployment of system components across hardware nodes, showing servers, devices, execution environments, and their communication links.

```plantuml
@startuml
node "User Device" {
  [Web Browser] --> [Flash Player]
}

node "Internet" {
  [S2S Website]
}

node "Server" {
  [Web Server] --> [Load Balancer]
  [Load Balancer] --> [Application Server]
  [Application Server] --> [Database Server]
}

[Web Browser] --> [S2S Website]
[S2S Website] --> [Web Server]
@enduml
```

#### 2. Container Diagram
The Container Diagram represents the high-level software architecture, including applications, databases, APIs, and their interactions. It illustrates how containers (e.g., microservices, web servers) are structured within the system.

```plantuml
@startuml
artifact "Web Application" {
  [User Interface]
  [Question Engine]
  [Storyline Manager]
  [Admin Interface]
  [Content Management System]
  [Security Module]
  [User Authentication System]
}

artifact "External Resources" {
  [Resource Integration Layer]
  [External Content API]
}

artifact "Infrastructure" {
  [Web Server]
  [Load Balancer]
  [Network Infrastructure]
}

[User Interface] --> [Web Server]
[Question Engine] --> [Storyline Manager]
[Admin Interface] --> [Content Management System]
[Security Module] --> [User Authentication System]
[Resource Integration Layer] --> [External Content API]

[Web Server] --> [Load Balancer]
[Load Balancer] --> [Network Infrastructure]
@enduml
```

These diagrams provide a clear and informative view of the system's architecture, illustrating the deployment and interaction of various components within the Space Fractions system.To create a Use Case Diagram using PlantUML syntax, we will illustrate how users interact with the Space Fractions system. This will include actors, use cases, and relationships such as includes, extends, and associations to represent system functionality from a user perspective.

```plantuml
@startuml

actor User
actor Administrator

usecase "View Introductory Movie" as UC1
usecase "Skip Introductory Movie" as UC2
usecase "Access Main Menu" as UC3
