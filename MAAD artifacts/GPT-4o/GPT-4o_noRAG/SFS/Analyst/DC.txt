The Design Constraints are:

1. DC-001: The Space Fractions system must be web-based and accessible via a web browser that supports Flash movies.
2. DC-002: The system must be compatible with any Internet-accessible computer without requiring new hardware.
3. DC-003: The system must not be dependent on any other software and should function as a standalone application.
4. DC-004: The system must ensure that the introductory and main menu movies can be downloaded quickly, ideally within one minute using a modem connection.
5. DC-005: The system must maintain consistent behavior across different web browser configurations, despite potential variations in interface appearance.
6. DC-006: The system must allow for real-time updates to the fraction questions without requiring system restarts or interruptions.
7. DC-007: The system must provide a secure environment, relying on the security features of the web browser used to access it.
8. DC-008: The system must be designed to support only one user per instance, although multiple users can access and download the system from the Internet.
9. DC-009: The system must include a user-friendly interface for administrators to update and edit questions, ensuring ease of use and maintainability.
10. DC-010: The system must be reliable, with extensive testing conducted by team members and mentors to ensure functionality and performance.
11. DC-011: The system must be maintainable, with a focus on ease of updates and modifications to the educational content and system features.
