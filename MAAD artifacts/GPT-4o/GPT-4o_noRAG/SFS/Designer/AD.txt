# Space Fractions System Architecture Document

## 1. Goals

The primary objectives of the Space Fractions system architecture are:

- **Compatibility and Accessibility**: Ensure the system is accessible via any web browser that supports Flash, providing a consistent user experience across different platforms and devices.
- **Modularity and Maintainability**: Design a modular architecture that allows for easy updates and maintenance of educational content and system features.
- **Security and Reliability**: Implement robust security measures aligned with web browser standards to protect user data and ensure reliable system performance.
- **Adaptability and User Experience**: Create a dynamic and adaptive system that personalizes the storyline based on user progress, enhancing the educational experience.
- **Extensibility and Interoperability**: Support integration with external educational resources, allowing for seamless addition of new content and resources.

## 2. Detailed Architecture Design

### System Components and Modules

1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - **Components**: Main Menu, Introductory Movie, Help Section
   - **Interactions**: Provides navigation and interaction points for users.

2. **Gameplay**
   - **Components**: Question Engine, Storyline Manager, Score Calculator
   - **Interactions**: Manages the presentation of questions, adapts the storyline, and calculates scores.

3. **Admin Tools**
   - **Components**: Question Updater, Admin Interface
   - **Interactions**: Allows administrators to update and manage game content.

4. **External Resources**
   - **Components**: Math Umbrella, Resource Integration Layer
   - **Interactions**: Integrates external educational resources.

5. **System Infrastructure**
   - **Components**: Web Server, Load Balancer, Network Infrastructure
   - **Interactions**: Supports system availability and performance.

6. **Security**
   - **Components**: Security Module, User Authentication System
   - **Interactions**: Ensures secure user interactions and data protection.

7. **Compatibility**
   - **Components**: Web Browser Compatibility Layer, Cross-Platform Compatibility Layer
   - **Interactions**: Ensures system compatibility across different browsers and platforms.

### Interactions and Interfaces

- **User Interface to Gameplay**: The UI interacts with the Question Engine to present questions and receive user input.
- **Gameplay to Admin Tools**: The Question Engine interfaces with the Admin Interface for content updates.
- **External Resources to System Infrastructure**: The Resource Integration Layer communicates with the Web Server to access external content.
- **Security to System Infrastructure**: The Security Module ensures secure access to the Web Server.

## 3. Component & Connector Specifications

### Communication Protocols

- **REST API**: Used for communication between the Web Server and external resources, providing a standardized interface for data exchange.
- **Event-Driven Messaging**: Utilized within the system to handle user interactions and adapt the storyline dynamically.

### Error-Handling Mechanisms

- **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallback options for non-Flash environments to maintain usability.
- **Error Logging**: Centralized logging of errors for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Performance Thresholds

- **Response Time**: Ensure immediate output timing for responsive gameplay.
- **Load Handling**: Support multiple concurrent users with efficient load balancing.

## 4. Key Technologies

### Infrastructure Configuration

- **Web Server**: Apache or Nginx configured for high availability and performance.
- **Load Balancer**: HAProxy for distributing traffic and ensuring system reliability.
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing user data and game content.

### Scalability and Fault-Tolerance Trade-offs

- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling of web servers and load balancers to accommodate increased user load.
- **Fault-Tolerance**: Redundant server configurations and regular backups to ensure data integrity and system availability.

## 5. Design Decisions

### Chosen Design Patterns

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates concerns within the system, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
- **Observer Pattern**: Used for dynamic storyline adaptation based on user progress.

### Technology Selections

- **Flash**: Chosen for compatibility with existing educational content, despite its limitations.
- **REST API**: Selected for its simplicity and widespread adoption in web applications.

## 6. Design Decision Rationale

### Technology Choices

- **Flash**: Despite its deprecation, Flash was chosen due to existing content dependencies and the need for compatibility with legacy systems.
- **REST API**: Provides a lightweight and flexible communication protocol suitable for web-based applications.

### Pattern Adoption

- **MVC**: Facilitates separation of concerns, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
- **Observer Pattern**: Enables real-time updates and dynamic content delivery, enhancing user experience.

## 7. Executable Prototype Skeleton

### Code Scaffolding for Critical Modules

```python
# User Interface Module
class UserInterface:
    def display_intro(self):
        pass

    def display_main_menu(self):
        pass

    def navigate(self):
        pass

# Question Engine Module
class QuestionEngine:
    def present_question(self):
        pass

    def evaluate_answer(self):
        pass

    def provide_feedback(self):
        pass

# Storyline Manager Module
class StorylineManager:
    def adapt_storyline(self):
        pass

    def display_concluding_scene(self):
        pass

# Admin Interface Module
class AdminInterface:
    def update_questions(self):
        pass

    def validate_data(self):
        pass

# Security Module
class SecurityModule:
    def ensure_security(self):
        pass
```

This code scaffolding provides a basic structure for the critical modules within the Space Fractions system, allowing for further development and implementation of detailed functionalities.
