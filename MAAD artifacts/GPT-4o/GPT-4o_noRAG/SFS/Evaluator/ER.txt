#### 2. Quality Attribute Analysis

- **Performance Simulation**: 
  - Under a simulated load of 10,000 concurrent users, the system experiences a 15% increase in latency, primarily due to database query bottlenecks.
  - The system maintains a response time of under 200ms for 85% of requests, with edge caching significantly reducing load times for static content.

- **Security Vulnerabilities**:
  - The API Gateway currently lacks rate limiting, which could expose the system to denial-of-service attacks.
  - User authentication mechanisms are robust, but session management could be improved to prevent session hijacking.

#### 3. Risk Identification

- **Performance**: 
  - Risk of increased latency under high load due to database bottlenecks.
  - Potential for degraded user experience if caching strategies are not optimized.

- **Scalability**: 
  - Current architecture may not scale efficiently beyond 20,000 concurrent users without significant infrastructure upgrades.

- **Maintainability**: 
  - The reliance on Flash for the user interface poses a risk as it is deprecated and unsupported in modern browsers.

- **Security**: 
  - Lack of rate limiting on the API Gateway is a significant security risk.
  - Potential vulnerabilities in session management could lead to unauthorized access.

- **Compliance**: 
  - Deployment to AWS may conflict with on-premises compliance rule 4.2, which requires data residency within specific geographic locations.

#### 4. Optimization Recommendations

- **Refactoring Steps**:
  - Replace Flash-based components with HTML5 to ensure compatibility with modern browsers and improve maintainability.
  - Implement rate limiting on the API Gateway to mitigate the risk of denial-of-service attacks.
  - Optimize database queries and consider implementing a distributed database architecture to improve performance under load.
  - Introduce session management improvements, such as token-based authentication, to enhance security.

- **Design Improvements**:
  - Consider migrating inter-service communication from REST to gRPC to reduce latency and improve performance.
  - Evaluate the use of a content delivery network (CDN) to further reduce latency for global users.
  - Explore containerization and orchestration solutions, such as Kubernetes, to improve scalability and deployment flexibility.
