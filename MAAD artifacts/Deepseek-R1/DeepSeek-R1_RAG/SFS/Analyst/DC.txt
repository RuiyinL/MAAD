The Design Constraints are:

1. DC-001: The system must be compatible with web browsers capable of running Flash movies, as the core functionality depends on Flash-based animations and interactions.
2. DC-002: The system must integrate with a web-based umbrella menu system to provide access to other fraction-related projects (e.g., decimals, percents).
3. DC-003: No new hardware may be required for the system; it must operate on standard internet-connected computers with existing configurations.
4. DC-004: The user interface must support mouse-only input for all interactions, including answer selection and navigation.
5. DC-005: User scores must be stored as local data within the system (e.g., via browser storage) rather than on a remote server.
6. DC-006: Administrative interfaces for updating questions must use simplified web forms with pulldown menus and text fields to ensure usability for non-technical administrators.
7. DC-007: The system must function on any operating system with a compatible web browser, ensuring cross-platform accessibility.
8. DC-008: Maintainability must be prioritized, requiring modular design for easy updates to questions, storylines, and Flash components.
9. DC-009: Security mechanisms must align with the capabilities of standard web browsers, with no additional security layers beyond browser-native features.
10. DC-010: Introductory and menu movies must be optimized for quick loading (â‰¤1 minute download time on a modem connection).
11. DC-011: The storyline must dynamically adapt to user progress and critical question responses, requiring a flexible narrative architecture.
12. DC-012: Links to external S2S projects in the Math Umbrella component must open in separate browser windows or tabs.
13. DC-013: The introductory movie must include a skip functionality triggered by a single mouse click.
14. DC-014: Fraction inputs for velocity calculations must validate integers, non-zero denominators, and predefined value ranges in real time.
15. DC-015: Question updates by administrators must be saved in server-hosted files that the system can read dynamically without requiring restarts.
