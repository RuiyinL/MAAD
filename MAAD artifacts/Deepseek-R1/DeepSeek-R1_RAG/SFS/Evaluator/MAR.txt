[mismatch 1]  
- **Description**: The SRS specifies Flash as a core dependency, but the architectural decision acknowledges Flash's deprecation and security risks without reflecting mitigation plans in the requirements.  
- **Impact**: Modern browsers block Flash by default, rendering the system unusable for most users. This directly contradicts NFR-001 (cross-browser compatibility) and introduces security vulnerabilities (NFR-004).  
- **Recommendation**: Update the SRS to include a phased migration plan to HTML5/WebGL. Implement feature detection in the architecture to fall back to static content for non-Flash browsers.  

[mismatch 2]  
- **Description**: The SRS requires client-side score storage but lacks explicit data integrity checks, while the architecture implements SHA-256 checksums without corresponding requirements.  
- **Impact**: Tampered scores could invalidate educational outcomes (ASR-008) and undermine teacher trust.  
- **Recommendation**: Add a requirement for checksum-based validation (e.g., "Local scores must be validated against tampering using cryptographic methods") and document the architecture's SHA-256 implementation as compliant.  

[mismatch 3]  
- **Description**: The architecture uses HTTPS and role-based access for the admin interface (ASR-004), but the SRS only mentions password authentication.  
- **Impact**: Insecure transmission of admin credentials could lead to unauthorized question modifications.  
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen the SRS security section to mandate HTTPS (NFR-004) and granular access controls. Update use case UC10 to include encrypted authentication.  

[mismatch 4]  
- **Description**: The architecture's "critical points" altering storylines (DC-011) lack corresponding requirements specifying how many critical questions exist or how they affect narratives.  
- **Impact**: Unclear expectations may result in inconsistent adaptive behavior, failing personas like Bobby (competitive motivation) and Alice (story-driven engagement).  
- **Recommendation**: Add detailed requirements specifying (1) ≥3 critical decision points per session, (2) measurable narrative divergence criteria, and (3) persona-aligned feedback rules.  

[mismatch 5]  
- **Description**: The architecture's client-side physics engine assumes uniform hardware performance, conflicting with DC-003's acknowledgment of variable client devices.  
- **Impact**: Low-end devices may exhibit lag during velocity calculations, breaking real-time responsiveness (ASR-003).  
- **Recommendation**: Add a performance floor requirement (e.g., "Velocity updates must process within 100ms on devices with ≤2GB RAM") and implement adaptive quality tiers in the PhysicsEngine.  

[mismatch 6]  
- **Description**: The Math Umbrella architecture sandboxes external links (NFR-004), but the SRS lacks security constraints for third-party resources (ASR-006).  
- **Impact**: Malicious external content could compromise the core system via iframe vulnerabilities.  
- **Recommendation**: Update ASR-006 to require resource whitelisting and CORS validation. Document the architecture's sandboxing as a compliance measure.  

[mismatch 7]  
- **Description**: The SRS mandates "simplified administrative screens" (DC-006) but doesn't address multi-question validation dependencies, while the architecture validates individual questions in isolation.  
- **Impact**: Admins like Claire might create contradictory critical-point questions, breaking narrative continuity.  
- **Recommendation**: Add a requirement for cross-question consistency checks and implement dependency graphs in the QuestionRepository.  

[mismatch 8]  
- **Description**: The architecture's file-based question storage (DC-015) lacks SRS-mandated versioning, risking content loss during concurrent admin updates.  
- **Impact**: Conflicting edits by multiple admins could corrupt question sets, violating ASR-010 (maintainability).  
- **Recommendation**: Add a version control requirement and implement file-locking in the AdminInterface component.  

[mismatch 9]  
- **Description**: The SRS specifies "adaptive systemplay" but doesn't define adaptation metrics, while the architecture uses a rigid decision-tree model.  
- **Impact**: Bobby's competitive persona might exploit predictable difficulty curves, reducing educational efficacy.  
- **Recommendation**: Formalize adaptivity rules in the SRS (e.g., "Difficulty increases after 3 consecutive correct answers") and enhance the StorylineEngine with probabilistic branching.  

[mismatch 10]  
- **Description**: The architecture's load-balanced deployment (NFR-010) contradicts the SRS's assumption of single-server hosting in DC-010 ("small size... modem connection").  
- **Impact**: CDN-driven content delivery might violate stakeholder constraints on infrastructure costs.  
- **Recommendation**: Reconcile DC-010 with NFR-010 by adding explicit scalability targets and cost ceilings to the SRS.
