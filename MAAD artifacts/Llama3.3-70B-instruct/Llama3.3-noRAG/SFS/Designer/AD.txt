**Software Architecture Document**

**Goals**

The primary objectives of this software architecture are to:

1. Design a reliable and secure system that prioritizes user data protection.
2. Ensure maintainability by designing the system with ease of maintenance and updates in mind.
3. Balance performance, scalability, and reliability to meet the requirements of the product.

**Detailed Architecture Design**

The system consists of the following components and modules:

1. **User Interface Module**: Responsible for handling user input and displaying output.
2. **Business Logic Module**: Contains the core functionality of the system, including data processing and decision-making.
3. **Data Storage Module**: Manages data storage and retrieval, ensuring reliable and secure access to user data.
4. **Security Module**: Implements security measures to protect user data and maintain a trustworthy reputation.

**Component & Connector Specifications**

1. **REST API Contract**: Define the communication protocol for interacting with external services.
2. **Event-Driven Messaging Format**: Specify the format for event-driven messaging between components.
3. **Error-Handling Mechanisms**: Implement error-handling mechanisms to ensure reliable system operation.
4. **Performance Thresholds**: Establish performance thresholds to monitor and optimize system performance.

**Key Technologies**

1. **Infrastructure Configuration**: Propose infrastructure configuration, including resource allocation and scalability considerations.
2. **Scalability/Fault-Tolerant Design**: Highlight the trade-offs between scalability and fault tolerance in the design.

**Design Decisions**

1. **Reliability through Extensive Testing**: Prioritize reliability by designing a system that is extensively tested to ensure user data protection.
2. **Maintainability**: Design the system with ease of maintenance and updates in mind, reducing the cost and effort required for future modifications.
