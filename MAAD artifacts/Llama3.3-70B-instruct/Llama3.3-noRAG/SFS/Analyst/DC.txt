Here are the Design Constraints (DC) based on the provided software requirements specification:

The Design Constraints are:

1. DC-001: The system must provide a personalized ending that varies from one session to another based on the player's performance, emphasizing educational progress and decisions.
2. DC-002: The Question Updater tool must be designed for ease of use, allowing administrators to efficiently input new data or modify existing questions through a user-friendly interface with pulldown menus and text fields.
3. DC-003: The system must perform validation checks on submitted data to ensure completeness and contextual relevance to the game's educational objectives, maintaining the quality and integrity of the system content.
4. DC-004: The Math Umbrella component must provide players with easy access to a curated selection of external S2S projects that are specifically tailored to sixth graders, organized by mathematical topics such as fractions.
5. DC-005: The system must ensure seamless integration of new or revised educational material into the game sequence without requiring system restarts or interruptions.
6. DC-006: Only one person can use a single instance of the Space Fractions system at any given time, but multiple users can access and download the content for use on their computers.
7. DC-007: The system must be designed to minimize download times for introductory and main menu movies, allowing for quick access to the game.
8. DC-008: The system must ensure security by adhering to the same level of security as the web browser that will run the product.
9. DC-009: The system must be available over the Internet via the S2S website, with reliability ensured through extensive testing by team members and mentors.
10. DC-010: Maintainability is a primary goal for this project, requiring careful design and implementation to ensure ease of maintenance and updates.
