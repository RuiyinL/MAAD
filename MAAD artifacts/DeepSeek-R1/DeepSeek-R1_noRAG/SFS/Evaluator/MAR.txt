[mismatch 1]  
- **Description**: The SRS mandates Flash as a core dependency, but modern browsers no longer support Flash. The architecture includes Ruffle as a fallback but does not address compatibility risks for primary Flash usage.  
- **Impact**: The system may fail to run on most modern browsers, excluding the target audience (sixth-grade students) who likely use updated devices. Alice (a persona) may struggle with technical setup, defeating the system’s educational purpose.  
- **Recommendation**: Replace Flash with HTML5/WebGL for animations and interactions. If Flash is unavoidable, explicitly document Ruffle integration as a mandatory fallback and test across all target browsers.  

[mismatch 2]  
- **Description**: The SRS specifies a password-based admin authentication, but the architecture implements OAuth/RBAC via Auth0. This introduces a mismatch in authentication mechanisms.  
- **Impact**: Administrators (e.g., Claire) may face unnecessary complexity during question updates, conflicting with the SRS’s "simplified administrative screens" requirement.  
- **Recommendation**: Implement a password-based authentication system as specified. If enhanced security is needed, seek client approval to revise the SRS and include multi-factor authentication.  

[mismatch 3]  
- **Description**: The SRS states the system "will not be dependent on any other software," but the architecture relies on third-party services (AWS CloudFront, Auth0, Kubernetes).  
- **Impact**: External service outages or configuration changes could disrupt system availability, violating reliability requirements.  
- **Recommendation**: Clarify the SRS’s scope regarding infrastructure dependencies. If third-party services are unavoidable, add redundancy (e.g., multi-CDN) and document contingency plans.  

[mismatch 4]  
- **Description**: The SRS requires adaptive storylines based on "critical questions," but the architecture’s `StorylineEngine` does not explicitly map critical decisions to narrative branches in UML diagrams.  
- **Impact**: The system may fail to personalize the storyline, reducing engagement for competitive users like Bobby.  
- **Recommendation**: Extend the `DecisionTreeModule` in the class diagram to include a `CriticalQuestionEvaluator` component and update the activity diagram to show branch adjustments during critical decisions.  

[mismatch 5]  
- **Description**: The SRS emphasizes accessibility for non-technical users (e.g., Alice), but the architecture lacks usability testing components or accessibility features (e.g., screen reader support).  
- **Impact**: Users with low computer affinity may struggle with navigation, undermining the system’s educational goals.  
- **Recommendation**: Add an `AccessibilityModule` to the logical view for features like keyboard navigation and text-to-speech. Conduct usability tests with representative personas during development.  

[mismatch 6]  
- **Description**: The SRS requires "custom fraction questions" to be saved on the web server, but the deployment diagram does not show how the `CMS` interacts with the server’s file system.  
- **Impact**: Administrators may be unable to persist updated questions, leading to data loss or corruption.  
- **Recommendation**: Update the component diagram to include a `FileSystemAdapter` connecting the `CMS` to server storage, and specify file-format validation in the `AdminInterface` sequence diagram.  

[mismatch 7]  
- **Description**: The SRS specifies mouse-click-only input, but the architecture’s `InputValidationModule` (process view) does not account for touchscreen compatibility.  
- **Impact**: Students using tablets or touch-enabled devices may face input recognition issues.  
- **Recommendation**: Extend the `Frontend UI` component to support touch events and update the state diagram to include touch-input transitions.  

[mismatch 8]  
- **Description**: The SRS requires "feedback based on system scores," but the architecture’s `ScoreCalculationEngine` lacks ties to feedback messages in UML diagrams.  
- **Impact**: Generic or missing feedback could reduce learning efficacy for users like Alice.  
- **Recommendation**: Add a `FeedbackGenerator` class in the logical view, linked to `ScoreCalculator`, and define feedback rules in the activity diagram’s "Provide feedback" step.
