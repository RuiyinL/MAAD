### Architecture Evaluation Report for "Space Fractions" System Using ATAM Method  

---

#### 1. **Architectural Presentation**  
The system follows a **layered client-server architecture** with a Flash-based frontend and cloud-hosted backend services. Key components:  
- **Frontend**: Flash UI, Local Storage (score persistence), and External Link Handler.  
- **Game Engine**: Storyline Engine (adaptive branching logic), Score Calculator, and Game State Manager.  
- **Administration**: Web-based Question Updater with CMS integration.  
- **Media Delivery**: CDN-optimized assets streamed via Media Delivery Server.  
- **Security**: Input validation, session management, and RBAC for admin access.  
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-hosted servers with load balancing and caching.  

The architecture emphasizes **modularity** (separate packages for frontend, game logic, admin, and media) and **client-server decoupling** (browser ↔ cloud services).

#### 2. **Business Goals**  
1. **Primary Goal**: Improve fraction-solving skills for sixth-grade students through an engaging, story-driven system.  
2. **Secondary Goals**:  
   - Ensure accessibility via web browsers with minimal hardware requirements.  
   - Support adaptive learning paths (storyline branching) for personalized experiences.  
   - Enable teachers (Claire) to update content easily.  
   - Maintain compatibility with legacy Flash-based infrastructure.

#### 3. **Prioritized Quality Attribute Scenarios**  
| Quality Attribute | Scenario | Priority |  
|-------------------|----------|----------|  
| **Performance** | When a student starts the system, the introductory movie loads within 5 seconds on a 56k modem. | High |  
| **Usability** | Alice (computer-averse student) navigates the help section independently within 2 clicks. | High |  
| **Maintainability** | Claire updates 10 questions in the CMS within 5 minutes using the admin interface. | Medium |  
| **Security** | Admin credentials are validated with salted hashing to prevent unauthorized question edits. | Medium |  
| **Modifiability** | New fraction question types (e.g., mixed numbers) can be added without modifying the Storyline Engine. | Low |

#### 4. **Risks and Non-Risks**  
| Risk/Non-Risk | Description |  
|---------------|-------------|  
| **Risk**: Flash Dependency | Flash is deprecated; future browser incompatibilities may break the system. |  
| **Risk**: LocalStorage Security | Storing scores locally exposes data to tampering (e.g., Bobby editing his score). |  
| **Risk**: Admin Interface Exposure | The admin portal lacks MFA, risking unauthorized access. |  
| **Non-Risk**: Modular Game Engine | Decoupled Storyline Engine and CMS allow easy content updates. |  
| **Non-Risk**: CDN Integration | Media assets load efficiently globally, meeting performance goals. |  

---

#### 5. **Risk Themes**  
1. **Obsolete Technology Reliance**: Flash and monolithic media delivery create long-term sustainability risks.  
2. **Insufficient Security Practices**: Lack of encryption for LocalStorage and weak admin authentication.  
3. **Client-Side Trust Assumptions**: Over-reliance on client-side validation for score tracking.  

**Impact**: These themes threaten **business goals** of accessibility (Flash issues) and security (admin/data integrity).

#### 6. **Mapping Architectural Decisions to Quality Requirements**  
| Architectural Decision | Supported Quality Attribute | Hindered Quality Attribute |  
|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|  
| Flash-based UI | Usability (rich animations for engagement) | Modifiability (hard to migrate to HTML5) |  
| CDN + Media Optimizer | Performance (fast asset delivery) | Cost (CDN expenses) |  
| LocalStorage Module | Performance (offline score persistence) | Security (data tampering risk) |  
| Modular Storyline Engine | Maintainability (easy content updates) | Complexity (branching logic testing) |  

---

#### 7. **Sensitivity and Tradeoff Points**  
| Point | Type | Impact |  
|-------|------|--------|  
| **Flash UI** | Sensitivity | Affects usability (engagement) and modifiability (tech debt). |  
| **CDN Usage** | Sensitivity | Directly impacts performance (load times). |  
| **SecurityModule Design** | Sensitivity | Determines data integrity (admin/auth flows). |  
| **LocalStorage vs. Server-Side Storage** | Tradeoff | Performance (fast access) ↔ Security (tamper-proof). |  
| **Admin Interface Usability vs. Security** | Tradeoff | Easy content updates (Claire) ↔ Robust access controls. |  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The architecture successfully supports core functionality (adaptive learning, score tracking) but faces risks in technology sustainability and security. Recommendations:  
1. Migrate from Flash to HTML5 for long-term viability.  
2. Encrypt LocalStorage data and implement server-side score validation.  
3. Add MFA to the admin interface.  
4. Conduct load testing on the Media Delivery Server.  

By addressing these, the system can better align with its educational mission while mitigating technical debt.
