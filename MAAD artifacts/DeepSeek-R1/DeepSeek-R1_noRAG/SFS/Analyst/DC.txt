The Design Constraints are:

1. DC-001: The system must be compatible with web browsers capable of running Flash movies, as core functionality (introductory movie, animations, and interactions) depends on Flash.
2. DC-002: The system must ensure consistent behavior across different browser configurations, even if interface elements vary due to browser-specific settings.
3. DC-003: No new hardware may be required; the system must function on standard Internet-accessible computers with existing hardware.
4. DC-004: The umbrella component must be a web-based menu system providing links to external fraction-related projects in a World Wide Web-accessible format.
5. DC-005: The introductory movie must allow skipping via a single mouse click at any time, with immediate transition to the main menu.
6. DC-006: The main menu must include a help section, a team summary, a link to the Denominators’ web page, and a clearly labeled start button to accommodate diverse user personas (e.g., Alice, Bobby, Claire).
7. DC-007: The question sequence must support dynamic, adaptive storylines that branch based on user responses to critical fraction-related questions.
8. DC-008: User scores must be stored as local data (e.g., browser storage) without server dependency to enable end-of-game feedback.
9. DC-009: The Question Updater component must include a password-protected web interface with input validation to ensure question integrity and contextual relevance.
10. DC-010: The Math Umbrella must open external S2S project links in a separate browser window to maintain system accessibility.
11. DC-011: Media assets (e.g., Flash movies) must be optimized for fast loading, targeting ≤1 minute download time on a 56k modem connection.
12. DC-012: Security mechanisms must align with the host web browser’s capabilities, with no additional security layers required beyond browser-native features.
13. DC-013: The design must prioritize maintainability, enabling easy updates to questions, storylines, and multimedia content via modular components.
14. DC-014: The system must undergo extensive testing to ensure reliability across supported browsers and user interaction scenarios.
